# Build Web Virtual Assistant With Generative AI Using IBM watson Assistant Integrated With WatsonX
Create a capstone project related to Watsonx and Watson Assistant, to be used as a Virtual Assistant our Tuban project capstone website [[Kabupaten Tuban blog](https://capstoneprojectkami.blogspot.com/)]

# Problem
Tuban is one of the regencies in East Java located close to Lamongan Regency. There are still many people who do not know what Tuban is and where Tuban Regency is located

# Solutions
So we have an idea to create a chatbot that helps users to get to know Tuban Regency better.

I use the blog [[Kabupaten Tuban blog](https://capstoneprojectkami.blogspot.com/)] to introduce Tuban Regency to tourist attractions, culture in Tuban Regency, Tuban specialties, and others through the blog and added a chatbot from IBM Watson to make the blog look more interactive.
